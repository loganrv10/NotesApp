# Notes App

## Overview
This Notes App is a Kotlin-based Android project that showcases best practices in software architecture, including MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) and Clean Architecture. It utilizes Koin for dependency injection, Room database for local storage, and RecyclerView for displaying notes in an intuitive user interface.

## Features
